Recent advances in tabular foundation models (TFMs) have yielded impressive performance gains on structured data, surpassing traditional machine learning methods. A novel finding suggests that pretraining TFMs entirely on synthetically generated datasets can be an effective strategy for designing generators that elicit desirable model properties. Prior research has primarily focused on developing high-quality priors over generative processes to enhance overall pretraining efficacy. Our work takes a distinct approach by parameterizing the generator distribution, allowing us to capitalize on adversarial robustness perspectives during training. Specifically, we introduce an optimality gap measure, defined as the difference between TFM performance and the best achievable performance estimated using strong baselines such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forests. Building upon this idea, we develop Robust Tabular Foundation Models (RTFM), a model-agnostic adversarial training framework capable of improving benchmark performance while leveraging synthetic data alone. Our results demonstrate significant gains in mean normalized AUC for the applied TabPFN V2 classifier, with up to 6% increases over original TabPFN and baseline algorithms, at an additional computational cost of less than 100k datasets.

Our research focuses on personal data that, if disclosed, may cause harm or violate privacy. We argue that sensitivity depends critically on context and introduce two novel mechanisms for detecting contextual sensitive data: type contextualization and domain contextualization. Type contextualization detects semantic types of specific data values within a dataset, considering the broader context in which they appear. Domain contextualization retrieves relevant rules from documents to determine the sensitivity of a given dataset based on its topic, geographic origin, or other contextual factors. Experimental results using large language models confirm that our mechanisms outperform commercial tools in detecting type-based sensitive data, achieving a recall rate of 94% compared to 63%.

The integration of artificial intelligence into decision-making processes has significantly influenced how individuals form opinions and make judgments.

To investigate this phenomenon, we employed a Bayesian Hierarchical Sequential Sampling Model (HSSM) to analyze trust decisions made by 102 Colombian university students across 30 epistemic and social scenarios. Our results indicate that differences in drift rate, the rate of evidence accumulation, are the primary drivers of context-dependent trust. Epistemic scenarios were characterized by strong negative drift rates, favoring AI, whereas social scenarios yielded positive drift rates, favoring humans. Initial biases and response caution had minimal effects on trust decisions.

Title: Empathetic Mediation by Large Language Models: Exploring their Potential to Foster Constructive Dialogue Online

Abstract:

As large language models (LLMs) increasingly facilitate online communication, understanding their capacity to promote empathy and constructive dialogue has become an essential pursuit in responsible AI research. This study delves into the potential of LLMs not only as moderators detecting harmful content but also as mediators that can comprehend and de-escalate online conflicts. Our framework defines mediation as a two-pronged process, involving (1) judgment, where an LLM assesses the fairness and emotional dynamics of a conversation, and (2) steering, wherein it generates empathetic messages to guide participants toward resolution. To evaluate mediation quality, we have created a large-scale Reddit-based dataset and proposed a multi-stage evaluation pipeline combining principle-based scoring, user simulation, and human comparison. Experimental results indicate that API-based models outperform open-source counterparts in both reasoning and intervention alignment during mediation tasks.

Unlike mere hallucinations resulting from limited capacity, deceptive behaviors involve deliberate misdirection through complex reasoning and insincere responses. This phenomenon has spread from text-based to multimodal settings, amplifying its potential harm. Current research predominantly focuses on textual deception, leaving the risks of multimodal large language models unexplored. In this work, we investigate the covert dangers of multimodal deception, introducing MM-DeceptionBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating deceptive behavior in combined visual and textual modalities. Our framework covers six categories of deception and reveals how models strategically manipulate users through multimodal manipulation.

The development of robust visuomotor policies for robotic manipulation remains an ongoing challenge in real-world settings, where the presence of distracting visual stimuli can significantly impair performance and safety. To address this issue, we introduce Naturalistic Inpainting for Context Enhancement (NICE), a novel framework that leverages image generative models and large language processing capabilities to enhance contextual understanding and reduce out-of-distribution gaps in imitation learning. NICE employs three editing operations - object replacement, restyling, and removal of distracting objects - to create synthetic experiences that preserve spatial relationships and maintain action-label consistency without requiring additional data collection or custom model training. Through this approach, we demonstrate the potential for photo-realistic scene enhancement using real-world scenes as inputs. Moreover, we showcase NICE's utility in downstream tasks by fine-tuning a vision-language model (VLM) for predicting spatial affordances and a vision-language-action policy for object manipulation.

This paper reexamines the relationship between temporal duration and information storage in deterministic multitape Turing machines. Contrary to prevailing intuition, we show that any run of length t can be simulated using O(sqrt(t)) work-tape cells by exploiting geometric and informational structure inherent in computation trees and algebraic replay engines. We recast this construction in terms of spacetime diagrams, interpreting the execution trace as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of local update events. By defining recursively a family of holographic boundary summaries, we demonstrate that the total description length of all stored data at any time is bounded by O(sqrt(t)). Using Kolmogorov complexity theory, we establish that every internal configuration has constant conditional description complexity given the appropriate boundary summary and time index, revealing that the spacetime bulk carries no additional algorithmic information beyond its boundary. Our findings imply a one-dimensional computational area law: there exists a simulation where the information capacity of the ""holographic screen"" needed to generate a region of volume proportional to t is bounded by O(sqrt(t)).

Deep nanoscale technologies present significant scalability challenges for SRAM-based cache memory, including high leakage current, low cell stability, and density limitations.

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots in young children's learning and play raises questions about how they understand these agents and how such understanding relates to engagement. To investigate, we explored anthropomorphism towards an AI chatbot during collaborative storytelling with 5-6 year olds (N = 23). Children participated in three sessions: interacting solely with the AI, with a parent, or jointly with both. Following each session, they reported their attributions of human-like qualities to the AI and parent through interviews. Behavioral engagement was indexed by conversational turn count ratios, while concurrent functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) measured bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) activation. Results showed that children attributed more human-like qualities to parents than the AI, although perceptions of the AI's perceptive abilities were relatively high. Anthropomorphism was not associated with behavioral engagement. In the right dmPFC, higher scores for perceiving the AI's mental states correlated with increased activation during solo-AI interactions and decreased activity during joint-AI-parent sessions. These findings suggest that stronger perceptive anthropomorphism can be linked to brain regions involved in interpreting mental states, while parent co-presence may facilitate understanding and regulation of novel AI experiences.

We then introduce a novel dual-reasoning training framework that integrates affirmative generation with structured counterfactual denial. Grounded in formal logic, cognitive science, and adversarial training, this paradigm formalizes a computational analogue of ""denying the antecedent"" as a mechanism for disconfirmation and robustness.

Specifically, we show that the efficacy of these defenses relies heavily on the assumption that the target distribution entropies are high.

Despite significant advancements in artificial intelligence across various domains, modern AI systems exhibit fundamental limitations in their ability to self-regulate and adapt autonomously in dynamic environments. This study reveals seven core shortcomings that constrain contemporary AI models: the absence of intrinsic monitoring capabilities, limited meta-cognitive awareness, rigid learning mechanisms, inability to reconfigure goals, neglect of representational maintenance, inadequate embodied feedback, and lack of inherent agency. By examining these limitations, we also propose a forward-thinking framework for developing AI architectures that mirror neurocognitive principles. We argue that these structural constraints hinder current models' ability to achieve robust generalization, lifelong adaptability, and real-world autonomy. Our analysis draws on comparative studies of artificial systems and biological cognition, integrating insights from AI research, cognitive science, and neuroscience.

Our approach involves inferring the ""how"" process from the ""what"" outcomes, transforming goal states into executable procedures. We develop a unified MoT-based architecture that integrates multimodal manual generation with action execution. Unlike previous VLA models, which directly map sensory inputs to actions, we introduce an innovative planning expert that generates intermediate manuals consisting of visual, spatial, and textual guidance. These manuals serve as the foundation for our Manual Chain-of-Thought (ManualCoT) reasoning process, where each step provides explicit control conditions and implicit guidance for accurate manipulation. To alleviate data collection burdens, we design a high-fidelity digital-twin toolkit that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate realistic manual data for planning expert training.

Title: Language Barriers in Psychiatric Diagnosis: Assessing the Efficacy of Large Language Models for Capturing Mood States Across Indian Languages

Abstract:
The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in psychiatry is hindered by their limited capacity to understand idioms of distress expressed in languages other than English. This study investigates the performance of LLMs in representing phrases related to four distinct mood states (depression, euthymia, euphoric mania, and dysphoric mania) in Indian languages. A comprehensive dataset comprising 247 unique phrases was compiled across 11 Indic languages and tested under seven experimental conditions. Our results show that direct embedding of native scripts fails to accurately cluster mood states. In contrast, translation-based approaches significantly outperform direct embeddings, with Gemini-translated English achieving the highest composite score (0.67) when embedded with a Chinese model. Surprisingly, human-translated English and subsequent translations into Chinese yield comparable performance. The poor performance of Indic-specific models highlights the need for LLMs to be built upon a foundation of understanding diverse local languages before they can effectively support psychiatric applications in India.",ai,ollama_llama3:latest,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00274v1,Lost without translation -- Can transformer (language models) understand mood states?,arxiv

""This study introduces a novel framework for learning universal latent actions from large-scale object manipulation videos. By incorporating both visual and physical priors into the learning process, we overcome limitations of previous approaches that solely rely on visual reconstruction objectives. The proposed Universal Latent Action Learning (UAL) framework takes task instructions and multiple frames as inputs to optimize future frame reconstruction and action sequence prediction. Notably, UAL's ability to predict action sequences, such as gripper or hand trajectories and orientations, enables the capture of richer physical priors, including real-world distances and orientations. To distill the learned latent actions into meaningful components, we decompose them into learnable motion and scene tokens that distinguish robot movements from environmental changes. Evaluation on both simulated (SIMPLER and LIBERO) and real-world robotic settings demonstrates strong performance, with our approach successfully completing challenging tasks using only 10 real-world trajectories per task collected on a Franka robot.

""This study explores the challenges and opportunities of networked multi-agent reinforcement learning (NMARL) when agents' rewards are interdependent and their policies are coupled. Each agent's reward function depends on its local state-action pair, as well as those of its direct neighbors, while its policy is informed by both local parameters and those of neighboring nodes up to a certain distance ($κ_{p}$-hop). The agents collaborate to maximize the discounted average cumulative reward. To address this interdependence, we introduce the concept of neighborhood-aggregated value functions and derive novel expressions for coupled policy gradients. Building on these theoretical foundations, we develop a scalable distributed algorithm (SDA) that enables each agent to rely solely on its local observations and those of its immediate neighbors to update its policy parameters. The SDA employs a truncated Q-learning approach to estimate the policy gradient without storing exhaustive value tables. Additionally, each agent maintains decentralized estimates of neighboring agents' policies to execute its own policy and collect data for optimization. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm converges to a stationary point of the objective function and showcase its effectiveness through simulations in a robot navigation scenario, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.""",ai,ollama_llama3:latest,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05447v1,Distributed scalable coupled policy algorithm for networked multi-agent reinforcement learning,arxiv

Title: Comparative Evaluation of Open-Source and Commercial Medical Image-Specific Vision Language Models for Chest Radiograph Reports.

This retrospective study aimed to assess the performance of open-source and commercial medical image-specific vision language models (VLMs) in generating chest radiograph reports. A total of 478 adult patients who presented with febrile or respiratory symptoms underwent same-day computed tomography (CT) scans along with conventional radiographs. The VLM-generated reports were evaluated by three thoracic radiologists using four criteria: RADPEER, clinical acceptability, hallucination frequency, and language clarity. Generalized linear mixed models were employed to compare the performance of each VLM against radiologist-written reports, treating CT as a reference modality. Notably, AIRead demonstrated superior report quality, with lower rates of disagreement (5.3% vs. 13.9%, P < .001) and hallucinations (0.3% vs. 0.1%, P = .21), while maintaining high clinical acceptability (84.5%) and language clarity (82.9%). In contrast, other VLMs exhibited higher rates of disagreement (16.8-43.0%, P < .05) and hallucinations (5.4-17.4%, P < .05). Sensitivity varied substantially across VLMs for common findings, with AIRead demonstrating the highest sensitivity range (15.5-86.7%). Overall, this study highlights the variable performance of medical image-specific VLMs in generating chest radiograph reports and underscores the need for careful evaluation of these models before clinical implementation.",ai,ollama_llama3:latest,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00271v1,Comparative Evaluation of Generative AI Models for Chest Radiograph Report Generation in the Emergency Department,arxiv

Circular Trace Reconstruction: Bridging the Gap between Upper and Lower Bounds
=====================================================

The trace reconstruction problem, where an unknown binary string $x$ is perturbed by random deletions with probability $p$, has long fascinated researchers. Despite significant advances in understanding its variants, including the circular case introduced by Narayanan and Ren (ITCS 2021), a substantial gap persists between upper and lower bounds for this problem. This study focuses on the latter variant, where traces are further subjected to random cyclic shifts. We establish an improved lower bound of $\tildeΩ(n^5)$ for reconstructing circularly shifted binary strings, significantly surpassing previous best-known bounds. Our approach exploits indistinguishability between two sparse strings $x$ and $y$, each having a constant number of nonzeros. By leveraging Fourier techniques, we show that any constant-sparse string can be reconstructed with $\tilde{O}(n^6)$ traces in the circular deletion channel, whereas general strings require an exponential number of traces in this same setting. These results underscore the need for innovative algorithms or new lower bounds to tackle non-constant sparse strings under cyclic deletion channels.",ai,ollama_llama3:latest,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02412v1,New Bounds for Circular Trace Reconstruction,arxiv

By integrating Kripke semantics, we introduce neurons capable of manipulating necessity and possibility operators over a set of possible worlds, enabling the model to serve as a logical guidepost for reasoning. The architecture is highly adaptable: users can either specify the accessibility relation between worlds or have it learned through an inductive neural network parameterization. This flexibility allows MLNNs to simultaneously perform deductive reasoning within a logical structure while optionally learning relational patterns from data. We demonstrate the versatility of this differentiable framework by minimizing a logical contradiction loss, which not only enhances resilience to inconsistent knowledge but also enables the discovery of non-linear relationships defining the logic of a problem space. Our experiments on four case studies - grammatical parsing, axiom detection, multi-agent trust dynamics, and deception detection in natural language negotiations - showcase how enforcing or learning accessibility can boost logical consistency without altering task architecture.

Our instantiation of this paradigm features two LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters, designed for slow and fast denoising stages, respectively. Surprisingly, our results show that simply incorporating these lightweight adapters into the base model yields both efficient acceleration and strong generalization without requiring extensive retraining. In fact, the LoRA experts are trained on a single V100 GPU within one hour using only 1 sample, yet they generalize well to unseen prompts across diverse benchmarks. Notably, our approach achieves up to 5-fold speedup over the base model while maintaining comparable visual quality.",ai,ollama_llama3:latest,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02899v1,Glance: Accelerating Diffusion Models with 1 Sample,arxiv

A recent variant of GANs, spatially adaptive denormalization (SPADE-GAN), enables direct conditioning on local probability maps, facilitating more efficient simulation. By integrating a pre-trained SPADE-GAN with geostatistical simulation, we propose an iterative inversion algorithm that leverages facies geometry and correlated continuous properties from seismic data. The approach involves training the SPADE-GAN to reproduce realistic subsurface realizations, followed by sequential stochastic co-simulation to predict spatial variability of facies-dependent continuous properties. Our method iteratively updates subsurface probability models based on similarity coefficients between simulated and observed seismic data. Demonstrated on both synthetic scenarios and field data targeting facies, porosity, and acoustic impedance from full-stack seismic data, our results show that this approach enables accurate multivariate prediction while mitigating the impact of biased prior data and accommodating local conditioning using well logs.",ai,ollama_llama3:latest,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02863v1,Leveraging generative adversarial networks with spatially adaptive denormalization for multivariate stochastic seismic data inversion,arxiv

As the demand for mobile data traffic continues to surge, wireless systems must adapt to meet the growing need for extreme spectral efficiency and flexibility across diverse service scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional feedback-based multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) transmission in fully-decoupled radio access networks (FD-RAN), we introduce a novel Correlation-aware Feedback-free MIMO Transmission and Resource Allocation (CaFTRA) framework that leverages artificial intelligence to predict channel state information based solely on user geolocation. By integrating a Learnable Queries-driven Transformer Network for CSI mapping from user geolocation, CaFTRA accurately captures frequency-domain correlations among resource blocks, significantly improving the precision of prediction and eliminating the need for real-time uplink feedback. This elimination enables base stations to expand their downlink transmission coverage without compromising performance or efficiency. To optimize resource scheduling in such extensive-coverage scenarios, we develop a low-complexity many-to-one matching theory-based algorithm for efficient multi-base station association and multi-resource block allocation, which is shown to converge rapidly to a stable matching.

Title: Enhancing Machine Intelligence through Evolutionary Reasoning Optimization

The quest for machines that can match human intelligence has long been a driving force in artificial intelligence research. While significant progress has been made in developing Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of tackling specific tasks, they still fall short when it comes to general reasoning abilities akin to those employed by the human brain. This paper explores whether LLMs can be evolved to acquire strong reasoning capabilities, mirroring human cognitive processes. To achieve this goal, we introduce an Evolutionary Reasoning Optimization (ERO) framework that leverages a population-based approach to evolve LLMs and optimize their performance on reasoning tasks. By initializing multiple models as a population and iteratively applying evolutionary pressure to maximize the quantified reasoning score of the fittest individual, our ERO methodology demonstrates its potential for enhancing the reasoning abilities of relatively weak language models. Notably, we reveal two unexpected findings: the latest LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) exhibit limited system 2 reasoning capabilities, while a simpler evolutionary loop can transform an initially weaker model (Qwen-7B) into one capable of powerful reasoning.",ai,ollama_llama3:latest,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05760v1,Evolutionary System 2 Reasoning: An Empirical Proof,arxiv

Furthermore, our agent employs a synergistic editor-evaluator policy optimization framework that enables self-improvement without external rewards, thus mitigating the issue of reward hacking in static models. This novel approach also supports fine-grained editing through seamless integration with Adobe Lightroom, allowing for both global and local adjustments. In evaluations on ArtEdit-Bench, JarvisEvo outperforms existing methods by an average margin of 18.95% across a range of preservative metrics, including pixel-level content fidelity (44.96%). Our results demonstrate the potential of this agent to revolutionize interactive image editing experiences.

This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in identifying fundamental logical relations between classes and properties within domain-specific ontologies. Specifically, we focus on axiom identification, which is crucial for structuring domain knowledge. We introduce OntoAxiom, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of nine medium-sized ontologies with diverse semantic domains. To evaluate LLM performance, we test twelve models using two prompting strategies: Direct, where multiple axioms are queried simultaneously, and Axiom-by-Axiom (AbA), which prompts for individual axioms. Our results show that the AbA approach yields higher F1 scores than the direct method, although performances vary across axiom types and ontologies. Notably, larger LLMs generally outperform smaller ones, while resource-constrained settings may still benefit from using smaller models.

The efficacy of vision language models (VLMs) in integrating visual and textual representations remains a topic of inquiry. Notably, many VLMs exhibit diminished factual recall performance relative to their large language model (LLM) backbones, prompting an examination of the mechanisms underlying multimodal fine-tuning. We contend that effective factual recall from visual inputs necessitates VLMs resolving two interconnected challenges: entity representation formation and knowledge retrieval based on these representations. To investigate this notion, we conducted a comprehensive benchmarking study involving 14 VLM architectures (LLaVA, Native, Cross-Attention), sizes (7B-124B parameters), and training setups against their original LLM backbones. Our findings indicate that 11 of the 14 models exhibit factual recall degradation.

The efficacy of Gaussian equivalence theory (GET) in capturing the behavior of complex features in high-dimensional linear regression has been extensively studied. However, numerical experiments have revealed that GET can fail to accurately predict model performance even for simple embeddings under certain scaling regimes. This breakdown is particularly pronounced in random feature models with quadratic scaling, where both the number of features and sample size grow quadratically with data dimensionality. Our investigation focuses on this regime and reveals that when target functions depend on low-dimensional projections of the data, GET yields inaccurate predictions. To address this limitation, we introduce a Conditional Gaussian Equivalent (CGE) model, which combines a high-dimensional Gaussian component with a low-dimensional non-Gaussian component. This hybrid framework retains the analytical tractability of GET while accurately describing random feature models in quadratic scaling regimes. Our analysis derives sharp asymptotics for training and test errors, which align with numerical simulations even when GET fails.

Our research introduces STCTS, a novel framework that leverages generative semantics to enable high-quality voice transmission at remarkably low bitrates (80 bps). By decomposing speech into linguistic content, prosodic expression, and speaker timbre, we apply tailored compression techniques: context-aware text encoding for efficient language representation (70 bps), sparse prosody transmission using TTS interpolation (<14 bps at 0.1-1 Hz) to preserve rhythm and intonation, and amortized speaker embedding for robust identity preservation.

Evaluations on LibriSpeech reveal a significant bitrate reduction of 75x compared to Opus (6 kbps) and 12x versus EnCodec (1 kbps), while maintaining perceptual quality as measured by NISQA MOS (>4.26). Furthermore, our framework demonstrates resilience under packet loss and noise corruption. Notably, we uncover a bimodal distribution of perceived quality, with sparse and dense prosody sampling rates both achieving high scores, whereas mid-range rates exhibit degradation due to discontinuous transitions – offering valuable insights for optimal configuration design. Beyond its impressive efficiency, STCTS's modular architecture enables privacy-preserving encryption, human-interpretable transmission, and flexible deployment on edge devices, providing a robust solution for ultra-low bandwidth scenarios.",ai,ollama_llama3:latest,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00451v2,STCTS: Generative Semantic Compression for Ultra-Low Bitrate Speech via Explicit Text-Prosody-Timbre Decomposition,arxiv

Multimodal large language models face significant challenges when tasked with reasoning over dynamic visual content. While recent thinking models generate explicit reasoning traces for interpretability, their reasoning often appears convincing yet lacks logical consistency or grounding in visual evidence. To address these limitations, we introduce two novel metrics: Consistency Index (CI), measuring the alignment between inferred explanations and actual answers; and Visual Dependence Score (VDS), capturing the extent to which reasoning relies on visual versus textual cues. Analysis across 11 video reasoning benchmarks reveals that current models heavily rely on linguistic priors rather than visual content. To overcome this limitation, we develop a reinforcement learning approach that enhances both temporal precision and reasoning consistency through a dual-stage post-training procedure. Our method combines timestamp-aware supervised fine-tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by the Temporal Alignment Reward (TAR).

By classifying listeners into standard Bisgaard audiogram types, we aimed to overcome calibration and procedural hurdles inherent in remote audiology assessments. Our analysis employed three machine learning approaches: unsupervised clustering, supervised classification, and explainable AI models. Principal component analysis revealed that the first two components captured over 50% of the variance in loudness patterns. Seven supervised multi-class classifiers were trained and evaluated using a large auditory reference database containing ACALOS data (N = 847). Our findings indicate that machine learning models can predict standard Bisgaard audiogram types, albeit with limitations, from calibration-independent loudness perception data.

To address the limitations of traditional sensor networks, we propose deploying portable sensing devices on mobile platforms like vehicles to collect data over large areas with minimal infrastructure investment.

Abstract:
The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has given rise to an array of agent frameworks, which promise simplified development processes for AI agents.

By examining real-world experiences of developers building AI agents with LLM-based frameworks, this paper provides a comprehensive understanding of the strengths and limitations of these tools. We conducted an empirical study analyzing 11,910 developer discussions across ten prominent agent frameworks, evaluating their performance along five dimensions: development efficiency, functional abstraction, learning cost, performance optimization, and maintainability. Our comparative analysis reveals significant differences among frameworks in meeting the needs of developers, highlighting opportunities for improvement and informing the design of future LLM-based agent frameworks that better support AI agent development.",ai,ollama_llama3:latest,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01939v1,An Empirical Study of Agent Developer Practices in AI Agent Frameworks,arxiv

AEM first identifies the most informative effect frame based on semantic relevance and visual quality, then extracts complementary cues from visual grounding and symbolic scene graphs to form robust representations. We further design a prompt-based detector that incorporates task-specific prompts and aligns each action segment with its intended execution semantics for mistake detection.

Our study reveals that existing approaches fall short due to misalignment between model and user reasoning.

Our approach formulates the problem as a non-linear, constrained optimization task within the OKLCH color space. Crucially, we preserve the original hue while adjusting lightness and chroma to ensure necessary modifications are made. The algorithm consists of three phases: binary search, gradient descent, and progressive constraint relaxation.

Evaluation on a dataset of 10,000 procedurally generated color pairs shows that our approach successfully resolves accessibility violations in 77.22% of cases, with 88.51% of successful corrections exhibiting imperceptible color difference (ΔE2000 < 2.0) according to standard perceptibility thresholds. The median perceptual change for successful adjustments is 0.76 ΔE2000, and the algorithm achieves this with a median processing time of 0.876 ms per color pair.

Our framework demonstrates that accessibility compliance can be achieved while respecting brand identity through a computationally efficient, perceptually-aware optimization. This approach is publicly available in the cm-colors Python library for designers to utilize.",ai,ollama_llama3:latest,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05067v1,Perceptually-Minimal Color Optimization for Web Accessibility: A Multi-Phase Constrained Approach,arxiv

Medication management, in particular, poses significant challenges for these caregivers, whose inadequate understanding and uncertainty surrounding regimen adherence can exacerbate patient outcomes and amplify their own stress, anxiety, and fatigue.

This study introduces two innovative wireless transmission protocols, dubbed Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted Spatial-Temporal Modulation (STMod) and RIS-assisted Space-Time Shift Keying (STSKe), designed to optimize spectral efficiency (SE) and physical layer security (PLS). The proposed schemes harness the dynamic properties of the RIS in each time slot, enabling adaptive spatial mapping at receive antennas. This approach leads to a significant enhancement of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at strategically selected antennas with minimal power consumption. Consequently, the proposed protocols can convey additional bits to receivers while reducing radio-frequency chain costs and improving SE. Moreover, they offer inherent PLS security benefits, as eavesdroppers are unable to accurately detect signals reflected from the RIS. The paper provides a comprehensive analytical performance evaluation of both schemes in terms of spectral efficiency, detection complexity, bit error rate, and secrecy rate. Simulation and analytical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed protocols, showcasing improved error resilience and robustness against wiretapping threats while highlighting their potential for future wireless applications.",ai,ollama_llama3:latest,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03518v1,From Reliability to Security: How RIS-Assisted Adaptive SM and SSK Enhances Wireless Systems,arxiv

The growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) raises concerns about its environmental impact beyond energy consumption. This paper quantifies the material footprint of AI training by linking computational workloads to physical hardware needs, focusing on specialized graphics processing units (GPUs). An elemental analysis of an Nvidia A100 SXM 40 GB GPU reveals a composition dominated by heavy metals such as copper, iron, tin, silicon, and nickel, with only trace amounts of precious metals. By integrating these findings with computational throughput data across varying lifespans and training efficiency regimes, we demonstrate that the material demands of AI training can be substantial. For instance, training GPT-4 requires between 1,174 and 8,800 A100 GPUs, translating to the extraction and disposal of up to 7 tons of toxic elements. Our scenario-based analyses highlight opportunities for reducing material demands through optimization strategies: increasing Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) from 20% to 60% can lower GPU requirements by 67%, while extending lifespan from 1 to 3 years yields comparable savings, and implementing both measures together reduces GPU needs by up to 93%. These findings underscore the need for considering material resource constraints in discussions of AI scalability, emphasizing that future progress must align with principles of resource efficiency and environmental responsibility.",ai,ollama_llama3:latest,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04142v1,From FLOPs to Footprints: The Resource Cost of Artificial Intelligence,arxiv

Building on recent work in the field, we demonstrate that On-chain Simple (OnCS) TFMs must also satisfy Off-Chain Influence Proof (OffCIP), ensuring that miners cannot exploit off-chain auctions to influence on-chain transactions. Our research reveals a key burn identity connecting allocation rules with burn rules, which allows us to characterize deterministic and randomized OffCIP and OnCS TFMs without cryptographic components. We show that these mechanisms, which we term posted-price mechanisms with specially-tuned burns, can only exist under conditions of infinite supply or prior-dependence. However, for certain settings involving finite supply and bounded prior distributions, we find additional OnCS and OffCIP auctions that do not rely on cryptography.

Using a case study of groundwater storage data in Bangladesh, we demonstrate that while temporal prediction is relatively straightforward, spatial interpolation proves more challenging. Our analysis reveals that nearest neighbors may not always be the most similar, and geological uncertainties significantly influence temporal behavior at individual points.

The application of Shapley values for feature attribution in Explainable AI (XAI) faces two primary limitations. Firstly, real-world payoff constructions often violate the additive assumption inherent to canonical Shapely frameworks, leading to biased attributions. Secondly, obtaining sparse explanations in high-dimensional spaces through dense value computation and thresholding is computationally costly and may compromise consistency. We propose Sparse Isotonic Shapley Regression (SISR), a unified framework that simultaneously learns a monotonic transformation to restore additivity and enforces L0 sparsity on the Shapley vector, thereby enhancing efficiency in large feature spaces. SISR's optimization algorithm leverages Pool-Adjacent-Violators for efficient isotonic regression and normalized hard-thresholding for support selection, ensuring ease of implementation and global convergence guarantees. Our analysis demonstrates that SISR recovers the true transformation across a wide range of scenarios and accurately identifies relevant features even in high noise settings. Furthermore, we show that irrelevant features and inter-feature dependencies can induce significant deviations from linearity in the payoff transformation. Experimental results in regression, logistic regression, and tree ensembles demonstrate that SISR stabilizes attributions across different payoff schemes, correctly filtering out irrelevant features while standard Shapley values exhibit severe rank and sign distortions. By integrating nonlinear transformation estimation with sparsity pursuit, SISR advances the frontier of nonlinear explainability, providing a theoretically grounded attribution framework for XAI applications.",ai,ollama_llama3:latest,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03112v1,Beyond Additivity: Sparse Isotonic Shapley Regression toward Nonlinear Explainability,arxiv

Title: Enhancing Off-Policy Learning in Continuous Control Domains via Decoupled Experience Replay

Abstract:
Off-policy deep reinforcement learning methods, particularly those employing Actor-Critic architectures, have been shown to excel in complex continuous control tasks. However, the uniform use of replayed transitions for both policy optimization and value function updates may not be optimal due to differences in their respective learning objectives. To address this limitation, we propose a novel experience replay mechanism that decouples transition sampling for the Actor and Critic networks. Our Decoupled Prioritized Experience Replay (DPER) approach allows for tailored batch construction, enabling more effective learning signals to be provided to each component. We integrate DPER with the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients algorithm and evaluate its performance on a range of standard continuous control benchmarks from the OpenAI Gym suite. Our results demonstrate that decoupling experience replay leads to improved training dynamics and policy quality, outperforming conventional strategies in multiple MuJoCo tasks. Overall, our findings highlight the potential benefits of decoupled experience replay for enhancing off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms.",ai,ollama_llama3:latest,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05320v1,Enhancing Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients on Continuous Control Tasks with Decoupled Prioritized Experience Replay,arxiv

In the first study, we found that LLM-generated ads achieved equivalent performance compared to human-written ads for matched personalities, with no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05). Building upon these findings, our second study tested LLM performance across four fundamental psychological principles: authority, consensus, cognition, and scarcity. Results showed AI-generated ads significantly outperformed human-created content, demonstrating a strong preference rate of 59.1% compared to 40.9% (p < 0.001). Notably, the AI's advantage stemmed from crafting sophisticated, aspirational messages that demonstrated superior visual-narrative coherence. Moreover, this quality superiority was robust: even after applying a detection penalty when participants correctly identified AI-origin, AI ads still outperformed human ads by a significant margin (29.4%). These findings highlight LLMs' progress in personalization and persuasive storytelling, with far-reaching implications for advertising practice given their negligible marginal cost and time requirements compared to human experts.",ai,ollama_llama3:latest,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03373v1,LLM-Generated Ads: From Personalization Parity to Persuasion Superiority,arxiv

Unlike previous work, which relies primarily on structural road network features, our approach incorporates environmental and physical information from the road surface and its surroundings to better capture the complexities of accidents. A large-scale multimodal dataset is constructed, featuring nine million traffic accident records and one million satellite images aligned with road graph nodes. Each node is annotated with relevant attributes, including regional weather patterns, road type, and traffic volume data (Average Annual Daily Traffic). By leveraging this comprehensive dataset, we evaluate the performance of various multimodal learning methods that combine visual and network embeddings. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in prediction accuracy when integrating both modalities, achieving an average AUROC of 90.1%, a gain of 3.7% over graph neural networks relying solely on structural information. The improved embeddings also enable a causal analysis of key contributing factors influencing traffic accidents using a matching estimator.

By combining Bayesian logistic regression with informed priors, we develop a hierarchical model that stabilizes player-level estimates and reduces uncertainty, particularly for players with limited shot data. Our approach achieves strong external validity, with correlations between hierarchical and baseline predictions reaching R2 = 0.75.

The current landscape of modeling in engineering, systems science, and formal methods is hampered by the limitations of binary relations, implicit semantics, and diagram-centric notations that obscure complex relationships and hinder automation. Hypernetwork Theory (HT) addresses these gaps by elevating the n-ary relation as the fundamental building block for representation and computation. Each relationship is instantiated as a typed simplex with two distinct modes: conjunctive alpha structures reflecting part-whole hierarchies, and disjunctive beta structures representing taxonomic relationships. The relation symbol R serves as a anchor point, fixing the arity and ordered roles of the corresponding hypersimplex. This allows HT to embed semantics directly into the modeling framework, enabling the representation of hierarchical and heterarchical systems without reconstruction or interpretation-specific tools.

This paper presents the core structural principles of HT, including a formalization of vertices, simplices, hypersimplices, boundaries, and ordering axioms (A1-A5). A comprehensive algebra of compositional operators is developed, comprising five fundamental operations: merge, meet, difference, prune, and split. Deterministic algorithms are derived for each operator, ensuring semantics-preserving behavior and reconciliation with the Open World Assumption through closure under rules.

The framework consists of three components: a Sub-query Generator that decomposes input queries and assigns tasks to experts based on semantic similarity; a Query Executor that processes nodes in the graph, identifying opportunities for parallelism; and a Response Aggregator that synthesizes intermediate responses into a coherent final answer. Our evaluations demonstrate Comp-LLM's superiority over monolithic LLMs of similar size, achieving up to 11% accuracy improvement with a model size reduction of 1.67x to 3.56x, without compromising performance relative to larger models in its family.",ai,ollama_llama3:latest,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22955v1,Experts are all you need: A Composable Framework for Large Language Model Inference,arxiv

CFO leverages flow matching to directly learn the PDE dynamics, sidestepping the need for backpropagation through ODE solvers. The approach involves fitting temporal splines to trajectory data and using finite-difference estimates of time derivatives to construct probability paths that accurately capture the true PDE dynamics. A neural operator is then trained via flow matching to predict these velocity fields. This framework exhibits inherent time-resolution invariance, allowing for training on trajectories sampled from arbitrary, non-uniform grids and querying solutions at any temporal resolution through ODE integration. Across four benchmarks (Lorenz, 1D Burgers, 2D diffusion-reaction, 2D shallow water), CFO demonstrates superior long-horizon stability and remarkable data efficiency.

Title: Hierarchical Semantic Alignment for Training-Free Image Clustering

Abstract:
Image clustering, a fundamental problem in computer vision, aims to group images into meaningful categories based on their visual content. Recent advances have leveraged external semantic knowledge from nouns to enhance clustering performance. However, these approaches often overlook the inherent ambiguity of nouns, which can negatively impact semantic representations and clustering quality. To address this limitation, we introduce CAE (hierarchical semantic alignment), a novel method for image clustering that does not require training data. Our approach integrates two types of textual semantics: fine-grained caption-level descriptions and high-level noun concepts from WordNet. We construct a shared semantic space aligned with image features by selecting relevant nouns and captions. Then, we utilize optimal transport to align the enhanced semantic space with image features, enabling more accurate clustering. Extensive experiments across 8 datasets demonstrate CAE's effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-1K, surpassing the previous training-free approach by 4.2% in accuracy and 2.9% in adjusted rand index (ARI).",ai,ollama_llama3:latest,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00904v1,Hierarchical Semantic Alignment for Image Clustering,arxiv

Title: Architectural Foundations for Trustworthy Autonomy in Large Language Models

Autonomous systems powered by large language models (LLMs) are transforming the landscape of connected devices. While this paradigm shift holds vast potential, it also introduces novel risks to safety and security that require principled solutions. Our study addresses this critical gap by developing a comprehensive framework for designing safe and reliable autonomous systems. We employ a systematic approach to identify vulnerabilities at three levels: individual agent design, collaborative multi-agent interactions, and large-scale interoperability. By analyzing the dual-use interfaces within each level, we uncover specific architectural features that contribute to systemic risks.

The development of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models has revolutionized robotic manipulation, enabling agents to execute complex actions with remarkable accuracy. While previous methods have employed trajectory-level optimization approaches such as Trajectory-wise Preference Optimization (TPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), these strategies often lead to coarse credit assignment and unstable training due to the long-horizon nature of action trajectories.

Title: Efficient Reasoning Control via Self-Awareness-Based Early Exit Mechanisms

Abstract:
The ability of large language reasoning models to generate extended chains of thought enables them to excel on complex tasks. However, this tendency to ""overthink"" can lead to wasted inference-time compute and compromised accuracy. Existing solutions for early exit rely heavily on auxiliary mechanisms or post-hoc analysis pipelines without providing formal guarantees. We propose LYNX, a novel online mechanism that leverages the model's own hidden-state awareness to make confidence-controlled stopping decisions. By attaching exit decisions to naturally occurring reasoning cues during generation, training a lightweight probe on hidden states at these cue tokens using supervised forced exits, and wrapping the resulting scores in conformal prediction, we achieve distribution-free control over premature exits. Notably, our approach involves training and calibrating this probe once on a generic mathematical corpus and reusing it unchanged across benchmarks, decoding temperatures, and tasks. Across three model families with parameter sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion, a single mathematically trained probe per base model yields strong accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. Our results demonstrate LYNX's ability to achieve competitive or superior Pareto frontiers compared to state-of-the-art early-exit methods while remaining fully online and providing explicit, user-tunable confidence guarantees.",ai,ollama_llama3:latest,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05325v1,LYNX: Learning Dynamic Exits for Confidence-Controlled Reasoning,arxiv

This paradigm shift presents significant challenges in accurately capturing user intent from minimal input while predicting multiple semantically aligned caption words and masks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Scene Graph Guided Diffusion Model that leverages structured scene graph features for correlated mask-caption prediction. The model consists of two key components: a Prompt-Centric Scene Graph Adaptor that maps the user's prompt to a scene graph, capturing their intention; and a diffusion process incorporating a Scene Graph Guided Bimodal Transformer that predicts correlated caption-mask pairs by uncovering intricate correlations between them. To ensure accurate alignment, we design a Multi-Entities Contrastive Learning loss that explicitly aligns visual and textual entities based on inter-modal similarity.

Federated data clustering under local differential privacy (LDP) presents a pressing challenge: striking a balance between preserving privacy and maintaining accuracy in the absence of iterative communication. Existing one-shot methods often rely on unstable pairwise distances or neighborhood rankings, which deteriorate rapidly when faced with strong LDP noise and heterogeneous data distributions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Gravitational Federated Clustering (GFC), a novel framework that leverages topological persistence analysis to identify robust cluster centers in privatized client centroids. GFC's key innovations include: a compactness-aware perturbation mechanism at the client level, which encodes local geometric information as ""mass"" values; and a server-side aggregation phase that extracts stable centroids by analyzing the topological structure of the gravitational potential field's superlevel sets. Theoretically, we establish a closed-form bound between the privacy budget ε and centroid estimation error, demonstrating that the potential field's Lipschitz smoothing properties exponentially suppress noise in high-density regions. Empirically, GFC outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ten benchmark datasets, particularly under strong LDP constraints (ε < 1), while maintaining comparable performance at lower privacy budgets. By reformulating federated clustering as a topological persistence problem in a synthetic physics-inspired space, GFC achieves unprecedented trade-offs between privacy and accuracy without iterative communication, offering a new perspective for privacy-preserving distributed learning.",ai,ollama_llama3:latest,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00849v1,Topological Federated Clustering via Gravitational Potential Fields under Local Differential Privacy,arxiv

However, even seemingly innocuous parameter modifications can have unforeseen consequences, such as catastrophic forgetting or alignment drift.

This paper presents Cohet, a pioneering framework that leverages CXL to enable coherent heterogeneous computing. By decoupling compute and memory resources, Cohet forms unbiased CPU and XPU pools sharing a unified, coherent memory space. A standard malloc/mmap interface is exposed for both CPU and XPU threads, allowing the operating system to manage heterogeneous resource allocation. To facilitate research, we also introduce SimCXL, a full-system simulator capable of modeling CXL sub-protocols and device types. Our evaluation reveals significant performance benefits: CXL.cache reduces latency by 68% and increases bandwidth by 14.4x compared to DMA transfers at cacheline granularity. We demonstrate the advantages of Cohet with two use cases - remote atomic operations (RAO) and remote procedure calls (RPC) - achieving speedups of up to 40.2x for RAO offloading and an average of 1.86x for RPC serialization offloading compared to PCIe-based designs.",ai,ollama_llama3:latest,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23011v1,Cohet: A CXL-Driven Coherent Heterogeneous Computing Framework with Hardware-Calibrated Full-System Simulation,arxiv

This paper addresses the temporal exploration problem on sequences of connected graphs with bounded maximum degree. The goal is to find the shortest sequence of vertices that visits every vertex and minimizes movement between adjacent vertices at each time step. Our results significantly improve existing bounds, achieving an exponential improvement over previous work by Erlebach et al. [ICALP 2019]. We establish a general upper bound on the exploration time, which depends on the average temporal maximum degree D of the graph sequence. Specifically, we show that there exists an exploration in O(n^(3/2) √(D log n)) time steps when each graph is connected and bounded by maximum degree. This subquadratic bound holds even when the underlying graph has bounded average degree, and it provides a unified approach for planar graphs or those with bounded treewidth. Notably, our result achieves a polynomial improvement over previous bounds when D = o(n/ log n).",ai,ollama_llama3:latest,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22604v1,Improved exploration of temporal graphs,arxiv

This paper presents a novel approach to open-world and anomaly segmentation, enabling autonomous driving systems to detect and segment both known and unknown objects in real-world scenarios. A key challenge lies in assigning meaningful labels to previously unseen regions, which existing methods often fail to address. To overcome this limitation, we propose Clipomaly, a zero-shot method that leverages the shared image-text embedding space of CLIP to dynamically segment unknown objects and assign human-interpretable names without requiring any anomaly-specific training data. Unlike traditional open-vocabulary approaches, our model can extend its vocabulary at inference time without retraining, facilitating robust detection and naming of novel anomalies beyond common class definitions such as those found in Cityscapes. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on established benchmarks while providing essential interpretability and flexibility for practical deployment in autonomous driving applications.",ai,ollama_llama3:latest,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01427v1,Language-Guided Open-World Anomaly Segmentation,arxiv

Reversing the protein folding process, where an amino acid sequence is designed from a target structure, remains a crucial challenge in computational protein engineering. Current approaches either generate sequences without leveraging evolutionary information or rely on pre-trained language models (PLMs), which are parameter-inefficient and limited by their training data size. In contrast, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Denoising Diffusion (RadDiff), an innovative method that harnesses the collective knowledge stored in large protein databases to inform sequence design. By efficiently searching for structurally similar proteins using a hierarchical strategy, RadDiff retrieves sequences that are then aligned residue-by-residue with the target structure. This alignment generates a position-specific amino acid profile that serves as an evolutionary-informed prior, guiding the denoising process. Our experimental results on benchmark datasets (CATH, PDB, TS50) demonstrate RadDiff's superiority over existing methods, achieving up to 19% improved sequence recovery rates and generating highly foldable sequences that scale effectively with database size.",ai,ollama_llama3:latest,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00126v1,RadDiff: Retrieval-Augmented Denoising Diffusion for Protein Inverse Folding,arxiv

Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has gained popularity for optimizing policies from pre-collected datasets. However, leveraging suboptimal or fragmented trajectories to improve policy performance remains an open challenge due to inaccurate reward propagation and value estimation. To address this issue, we introduce ASTRO, a novel data augmentation framework that generates distributionally diverse and dynamically consistent trajectories for offline RL. Our approach first learns a temporal-distance representation to identify distinct and reachable stitch targets, which enables the adaptive generation of connecting action sequences through Rollout Deviation Feedback. This feedback mechanism bridges the gap between predicted state sequences and actual arrived states by executing predicted actions, improving trajectory stitching's feasibility and reachability. As a result, ASTRO enhances policy learning and outperforms existing offline RL augmentation methods across various algorithms on challenging benchmarks like OGBench and standard datasets in D4RL.",ai,ollama_llama3:latest,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23442v1,ASTRO: Adaptive Stitching via Dynamics-Guided Trajectory Rollouts,arxiv

The vast potential of microRNAs (miRNAs) as therapeutic targets for pharmacology demands the development of efficient and accurate methods to predict their interactions with drugs. Traditional laboratory experiments are often limited by costs and efficiency constraints, hindering our understanding of miRNA-drug associations. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel machine learning framework, dubbed DMAGT (Drug-MiRNA Association Graph Transformer), which harnesses the power of graph neural networks to predict relationships between drugs and miRNAs. By transforming drug-miRNA interactions into graphs, leveraging Word2Vec embeddings for molecular structures, and employing a transformer-based model to capture relational patterns, our approach enables the prediction of associations with high accuracy. We evaluate DMAGT on three benchmark datasets (ncDR, RNAInter, and SM2miR) and demonstrate its superiority in comparative experiments tackling similar challenges. Furthermore, we validate the practical efficacy of DMAGT by focusing on two exemplar drugs, 5-Fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin, identifying 14 out of 20 predicted associations as experimentally confirmed.

Urban traffic congestion has become a pressing issue, exacerbated by the increasing demand for on-street parking. The allocation of spaces for parking further compounds this problem by reducing the effective road width available for vehicular flow. Leveraging advancements in vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity, we investigate the potential for dynamically configuring on-street parking to mitigate its impact on traffic congestion. Our approach formulates a dynamic optimization problem and adopts a data-driven methodology to inform the solution. A novel two-layer multi-agent reinforcement learning framework is proposed, featuring lane-level agents that determine optimal parking configurations and block-level agents that regulate overall parking levels. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework through comprehensive experiments using SUMO, incorporating both synthetic and real-world datasets from Melbourne.

A novel kernel decomposition framework is proposed to enable efficient and accurate image convolution with complex kernels on resource-constrained devices. Unlike existing approximations that rely on simulations or low-rank decompositions, our approach represents a target spatially-variant, dense kernel as a set of sparse kernel samples, allowing for differentiable optimization. To tackle non-convex shapes, we introduce an initialization strategy that minimizes poor local minima and avoid trapping in suboptimal solutions. Our framework further incorporates a kernel-space interpolation scheme, which extends single-kernel filtering to spatially varying filtering without retraining or additional runtime overhead. Experimental results demonstrate the superior fidelity of our method compared to simulated annealing and significantly lower computational costs than low-rank decompositions, making it an attractive solution for mobile imaging applications and real-time rendering scenarios while maintaining differentiability for seamless integration into broader learning pipelines.",ai,ollama_llama3:latest,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04556v1,Efficient Spatially-Variant Convolution via Differentiable Sparse Kernel Complex,arxiv

""This study tackles the fundamental challenge of hypothesis testing for pairwise comparison data generated by generalized Thurstone models $\mathcal{T}_F$ for arbitrary choice functions $F$. While previous research has focused primarily on parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification, we address the crucial problem of minimax hypothesis testing. By introducing a notion of topological separation between general pairwise comparison models and the class of $\mathcal{T}_F$ models, we establish upper and lower bounds on the critical threshold for testing that depend critically on the graph structure of observations. In the special case of complete observation graphs, this threshold scales as $Θ((nk)^{-1/2})$, where $n$ is the number of agents and $k$ is the number of comparisons per pair. We propose a novel hypothesis test based on our separation distance, construct confidence intervals, establish time-uniform bounds on type I and II error probabilities using reverse martingale techniques, and derive minimax lower bounds via information-theoretic methods. Finally, we validate our findings through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.""",ai,ollama_llama3:latest,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02912v1,Hypothesis Testing for Generalized Thurstone Models,arxiv

Additionally, we develop a novel generalization bound based on the Natarajan dimension for sine networks, leading to near-optimal sample complexity $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(p)$ for empirical risk minimization over constant-width sine networks.

This study investigates fundamental communication challenges in general radio networks, specifically the problems of k-broadcasting and k-gathering. In k-broadcasting, messages from multiple sources must be disseminated to all nodes in the network, while in k-gathering, information from multiple source nodes must be aggregated at a designated sink node. We consider these issues within the framework of distributed algorithms with advice, building upon prior work by Krisko and Miller (2021) that established an optimal bound on the size of advisory input for k-broadcasting problems. Our results show that this same upper bound applies to k-gathering problems as well, and we design efficient algorithms for both tasks with advisories of near-optimal size. The developed k-gathering algorithm operates in at most D + k rounds, where D is the network's diameter, demonstrating an optimal time complexity even among centralized approaches. By adapting our k-gathering solution to k-broadcasting, we achieve a communication protocol running in O(D + log^2 n + k) rounds.
